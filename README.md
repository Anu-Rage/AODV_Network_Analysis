# Performance Analysis of AODV Protocol in MANETs: Impact of Node Density and Transmission Range on Packet Delivery Ratio and Throughput using NS-3
This project uses ns-3 to analyze AODV in MANETs, with 100 nodes positioned via manet.csv. By varying transmission range and node density, we measure packet delivery ratio and throughput. Using ns3::FlowMonitor, we assess AODVâ€™s adaptability to network changes, highlighting its efficiency in dynamic routing.
