# AODV_Network_Analysis
This project uses ns-3 to analyze AODV in MANETs, with 100 nodes positioned via manet.csv. By varying transmission range and node density, we measure packet delivery ratio and throughput. Using ns3::FlowMonitor, we assess AODVâ€™s adaptability to network changes, highlighting its efficiency in dynamic routing.
